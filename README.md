## Booking App Clone

### Currently in development phase

Lots of issues to resolve:

- To avoid unnecessary API calls for /validate-token after a user logs in or registers 
- Add a loading screen to handle the async API calls
- Add a Google OAuth sign in feature

### Test the application
<b>You must have docker installed in your system.</b>

```bash
# In the root directory
docker-compose up
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.
